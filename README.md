There are two main options for you:

1. Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/medallyon/ahk-tools/releases) to download compiled binaries for:
	+ A `.zip` file containing all scripts
	+ Individual scripts
2. Clone this repository and compile scripts yourself using the [Ahk2Exe](https://github.com/AutoHotkey/Ahk2Exe) tool.

Once downloaded and/or compiled, optionally place the binaries into the `shell:startup` folder on Windows to launch the scripts on startup.
